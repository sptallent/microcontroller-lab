# EEC 345 Microprocessor Electronics

This repository contains assembly language programs developed as part of the EEC 345 Microprocessor Electronics course. The programs are written for a microcontroller or processor and demonstrate various concepts and functionality related to microprocessors.

## Programs

### Program 1

- File: `/Lab_1/main.asm`
- Description: Provides an example of a skeleton or template for an absolute assembly application. It sets up necessary symbols, includes derivative-specific definitions, reserves memory for variables, and provides a starting point for the program execution. The program includes a main loop, but the code within the loop is commented out for demonstation purposes.

### Program 2

- File: `/Lab_2/Lab_2_Problem_1.asm`
- Description: Solves a problem involving arithmetic operations and looping. It initializes variables and enters a main loop, where it performs a series of calculations based on specific conditions. The program showcases the usage of assembly instructions for control flow and arithmetic operations.

### Program 3

- File: `/Lab2/Lab_2_Problem_2.asm`
- Description: Updates the previous program (Program 2) by adding a problem-solving loop that increments a counter and performs arithmetic operations based on specific conditions. It showcases the usage of control flow instructions and arithmetic operations in a loop structure.
